# 🏷️ Fashion Image Classifier using ResNet50V2

This repository contains a well-structured implementation for classifying different categories, including article type, gender, season, and color using a ResNet50V2 model.

Key Notes:
- The model weights were manually downloaded and added since they were not downloading directly from ImageNet. Ensure that you have correctly downloaded and added path in the "weights" in the code. Download Link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a9TTa6IESM2lUylSd6xOgewqvt2mRFum/view?usp=sharing

- Due to time constraints, I have only trained the model for 3 epochs, as running for more epochs was taking hours. However, increasing the number of epochs would improve accuracy significantly.

- If required, I can deploy the model using Streamlit or by creating an API. Kindly let me know if you need deployment.

## 📌 Features
- Classifies fashion items into **140+ article types**  
- Predicts **gender (Men, Women, Unisex, etc.)**  
- Determines the **season (Summer, Winter, etc.)**  
- Identifies the **dominant color** of the clothing item  
- Uses **ResNet50V2 for **high accuracy**

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is taken from **[Kaggle (Fashion Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com)** 
- screenshots, I've added manually to test.
