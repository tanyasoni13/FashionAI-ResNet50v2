# FashionAI-ResNet50v2

# üè∑Ô∏è Fashion Image Classifier using ResNet50V2

This project uses **ResNet50V2** as a feature extractor to classify fashion images into **Article Type, Gender, Season, and Color** categories. The dataset consists of images labeled with their attributes, and the model is trained using **transfer learning**.

## üìå Features
- Classifies fashion items into **125+ article types**  
- Predicts **gender (Men, Women, Unisex, etc.)**  
- Determines the **season (Summer, Winter, etc.)**  
- Identifies the **dominant color** of the clothing item  
- Uses **ResNet50V2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)** for **high accuracy**

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset is taken from **[Kaggle (Fashion Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com)** 
- screenshots, I've added manually to test.
