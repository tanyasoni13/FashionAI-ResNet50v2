# FashionAI-ResNet50v2

# 🏷️ Fashion Image Classifier using ResNet50V2

This project uses **ResNet50V2** as a feature extractor to classify fashion images into **Article Type, Gender, Season, and Color** categories. The dataset consists of images labeled with their attributes, and the model is trained using **transfer learning**.

## 📌 Features
- Classifies fashion items into **125+ article types**  
- Predicts **gender (Men, Women, Unisex, etc.)**  
- Determines the **season (Summer, Winter, etc.)**  
- Identifies the **dominant color** of the clothing item  
- Uses **ResNet50V2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)** for **high accuracy**

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is taken from **[Kaggle (Fashion Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com)** 
- screenshots, I've added manually to test.

Pre-trained Model Weights  
The model weights were manually downloaded and added because they were not directly available from ImageNet. Ensure that you have correctly downloaded and placed the weights in the appropriate directory before running the code.
